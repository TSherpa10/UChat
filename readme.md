### Inspiration

This project was created in support on Ukraine. We wanted to create an application that could reach out to the people directly within Ukraine.

### What is does

Our chat application allows the rest of the world to communicate with people in Ukraine. When a user is loaded in, they create an account specifying their username, password, and location (through geo location notification).

The user is then directed to the chat application where they have options to add friends and chat with people in Ukraine or the rest of the world depending on where they reside.

Users outside of Ukraine have options to donate to the person they are speaking with.

### Contribution

#### David Fong

    I worked on building out the backend portion of this project with Mongo.db, Node.js, Express, and
    socket.io. I also designed the frontend architecture of the application and oversaw the project as a whole.

    Before the start of this project, I mainly worked on the frontend with React. However, during the interim of this project I leanred a lot about various backend technologies like socket.io, node.js, and express.

Gabby is located in "Ukraine" and David is located in "New York". In order for users to be connected one of the them has to be in Ukraine and one outside of Ukraine.

### Tech Stack (MERN)

We used Mongodb, Express, React, and Node.js to build out this application. We also used socket.io for messaging between users.
